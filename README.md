Hello, I’m Shubham Gupta, and I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project with you! Through this project, 
I’ve had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of data visualization and business intelligence.
Using Power BI, I developed a comprehensive financial analysis dashboard for Swipe Hub Store. 
This dashboard provides valuable insights into key metrics, 
including sales, orders, profit margins, and discounts, with comparisons between current and prior years. 
I’ve learned how to create interactive visualizations, build dynamic dashboards, and translate complex data 
into actionable business insights.

You can explore the live dashboard and see the results of my work here
